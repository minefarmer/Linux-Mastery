WHICH(1)                  General Commands Manual                  WHICH(1)

NAME
       which - locate a command

SYNOPSIS
       which [-a] filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       which  returns  the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be
       executed in the current environment, had its arguments been given as
       commands  in  a  strictly  POSIX-conformant  shell.  It does this by
       searching the PATH for executable files matching the  names  of  the
       arguments. It does not canonicalize path names.

OPTIONS
       -a     print all matching pathnames of each argument

EXIT STATUS
       0      if all specified commands are found and executable

       1      if  one or more specified commands is nonexistent or not exe‚Äê
              cutable

       2      if an invalid option is specified

which  [-a | -f] <SOMETHING>   # The pipe character beetween the {[-a and -f]} means that I need one or the other;  *** and anything inside the angle brackets is something I must have.


rich@dell-lmde:~$ which  [-a | -f] filename ...  # the three dots mean that I can have more than one filename
